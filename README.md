# Demographic_Data_Analyzer

This project was carried out as part of the course on the free Code Camp website:

https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/data-analysis-with-python-projects/demographic-data-analyzer

In this challenge I had to analyze demographic data using pandas. I got a dataset of demographic data, that was extracted from the 1994 Census database.

In this dataset I had to extract specific demographic information.
